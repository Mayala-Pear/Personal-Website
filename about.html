                <h2>Meaganrose Pearsall</h2>
                <p>Art has always been a part of me, even when I tried to set it aside for a “real job.” After joining the military and finding a stable career, art came back into my life, and this time, I want to see where it takes me.</p>
                <p>I'm 26, originally from Huntley, IL, but now I call Tucson, AZ, home, thanks to my military journey. It's where I met and married my husband, where we are both growing in our careers, and where we're raising our fur babies.</p>
                <p>I have a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology, and my military experience has given me a diverse background in IT. Now, I am at a crossroads, torn between pursuing a Master’s in fine arts or diving deeper into software development.</p>
